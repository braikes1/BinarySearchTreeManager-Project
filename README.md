# BinarySearchTreeManager Project
 
## Overview
A simple C program designed to construct a Binary Search Tree (BST) based on user input and perform an in-order traversal to display the elements. Users can insert nodes into the BST, and the program will arrange them accordingly.

## Features
- Dynamic insertion of nodes into the BST.
- In-order traversal to display the BST's elements in sorted order.
- Memory allocation for new nodes using `malloc`.

## Installation
1. Make sure a C compiler (like GCC) is installed on your system.
2. Download the `bst_manager.c` source file.
3. Compile the program: `gcc -o bst_manager bst_manager.c`.
4. Run the compiled executable: `./bst_manager`.

## How to Use
1. Start the program.
2. Enter numbers to insert into the BST (terminate input with -1).
3. The program will output the BST's elements in in-order traversal, showing the sorted order.
